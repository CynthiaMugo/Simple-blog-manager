      "content": "Bibimbap is more than just a meal — it’s a warm hug in a bowl. Rice, sautéed vegetables, spiced beef, and a fried egg on top. Drizzle some gochujang sauce and stir it all together — it’s color, texture, and comfort in every bite. My version stays true to the soul of the dish, but adds some extra crunch with toasted sesame seeds.",
